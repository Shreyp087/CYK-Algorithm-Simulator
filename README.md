## Introduction
This repository contains a Python implementation of the CYK (Cocke-Younger-Kasami) algorithm, which is used in the field of theoretical computer science for parsing context-free grammars. The CYK algorithm determines whether a given input string can be generated by a given context-free grammar.

## CYK Algorithm
The CYK algorithm is implemented in Python and is designed to work with context-free grammars. It constructs a parsing table and uses dynamic programming to determine whether the input string can be generated by the grammar. The algorithm follows these steps:
1. Initialize a table with terminals that can generate the input string.
2. Fill the table with nonterminals that can generate substrings.
3. Check if the start symbol can generate the input string.

## Usage
To use the CYK algorithm, follow these steps:
1. Enter the input string in the "Input String" text box.
2. Define the grammar in the "Grammar" text box using the format `nonterminal -> production | production | ...`. Separate multiple productions with the `|` symbol.
3. Click the "CYK Algorithm" button to run the algorithm.
4. The result will be displayed in the "Result" text box, indicating whether the input string can be generated by the grammar.
5. The CYK parsing table will be displayed in the "CYK Parsing Table" text box.

## Example
Suppose you have the following input string: `"ab"`
And the following grammar:
```
S -> AB | BA
A -> a
B -> b
```
Running the CYK algorithm will indicate that the input string can be generated by the grammar.
